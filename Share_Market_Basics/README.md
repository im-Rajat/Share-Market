# Share Market Basics


**Market Cap** : Share Value * No. of Share

**P/E Ratio (Price to Earnings Ratio)** : Share Value / EPS

**EPS (Earning per Share)** : Net Profit (ER) / No. of Shares

**Enterprise Value** : Market Cap - Cash + Debt

**Standalone** : Define your own company only and it's profit  
**Consolidated** : Define your own company + your investment + all profile (more useful than Standalone)

**P/B Ratio (Price to Book Value Ratio)** : Share Value / Book Value

**Book Value** : Asset Value that company have. If a company decide to sell itself. Then the value of per share asset value is Book Value (Practically not happen)

**Dividend Yield** : The companies which doesn't require more investment/money in future will provide more dividend yield to their shareholders.

**Promoter Pledge** : Promoter Holding shares that are mortgage (loaned). (Should be less).
=> Compare Promoter Holdings with previous years. If increasing that's good


**PAT Margin (Profit Margin)** : ((Selling Price - Cost Price) * 100) / (Selling Price). Buy = Rs.10, Sell = Rs.15, Profit Margin % = 33.33% (Calculated on Selling Price)  
**Mark Up Percentage** : ((Selling Price - Cost Price) * 100) / (Cost Price). Buy = Rs.10, Sell = Rs.15, Mark Up % = 50% (Calculated on Cost Price)

**ROE (Return on Equity)** : Invested 100 rupees and total amount become 200 rupees. 200-100=100% is ROE

**Possible** : Less PAT Margin more ROE. Selling at less price which means more products can be sell = more profile = more ROE

**Equity** : Giving stakes/share holding to person while borrowing money  
**Debt** : Taking Loan, Return money to the bank/person with interest

**Total DEBT/EQUITY (X)** : Should be very less, ideally 0. (Not apply to Banks, landing companies)

**Good Company** : Good ROE (>20) (more important than PAT Margin). Debt also should be less.

**Asset Turnover (X)** : You had buy a machine at Rs.100 then sell product made using that machine of Rs.500. That's the asset turnover. Turnover of a company using its assets. More asset turnover, more it's good.

**Cash Cycle (Days)** : Also known as cash conversion ratio. The difference in investing money and selling/getting profile. Less cash cycle more it's good.

**Bonus Issue** : will issue more shares to customers, Increase the no. of shares with decreasing the face value. But it will decrease the book value.

**Profile & Loss statement and Cashflow** : Compare total of Net profit in profile & loss statement with operating cash flow in cashflow, if net profit >>>>>>>> cash flow then the company showing got profit but didn't receive in cash. 4-5 % difference is fine. (compare for last 5 years)

**Rights Issue** : will give rights to shares holders to buy more shares in discounting prices. Problem is net profit is also divided with no. of shares. Bad for an investor, doesn't matter you apply or not in most of the cases.
